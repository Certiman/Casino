# Casino.py

## Configuration v1

The only configuration needed is `Main_Directory` which is a filepath pointing to the settings folder.

In the Settings.py file, edit:

```python
Main_Directory = os.getcwd() + r"\profiles\v1"
```

## Configuration v2

Pretty much the same as v1 only your file is now saved in a **JSON** file instead of a txt file.
