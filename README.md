# Casino.py

## Configuration

The only configuration needed is `Main_Directory` which is a filepath pointing to the settings folder and `Game_Profile` which contains the current profile.

In the Settings.py file, edit:

```python
Main_Directory = os.getcwd() + r"\profiles\v1"
Game_Profile = 'Admin'
```
